Crimes reported during 2016 and 2017.
Most relate to crimes occuring during 2016 and 2017, though 1% relate to crimes which occured in 2015.
0.5% relate to crimes which occured prior to 2015. 
The crime reaching the furthest back was one which occured in 1994, reported in December 2017.
The victim was a white female 45-64 years old.
The crime was at 1pm on New Years day, and occured in the Upper West Side of Manhattan by Central Park.
**Note: "Offenses occurring in open areas such as parks or beaches may be geo-coded as occurring on streets or intersections bordering the area."
So the offence could have happened in Central Park.
Cross referencing with the PDCode_PenalLaw shows that the offence reported was for harrassment - specifically, hazing.
